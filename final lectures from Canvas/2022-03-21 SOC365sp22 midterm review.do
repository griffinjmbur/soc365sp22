* PART III: review. 
	
* 1. Load the International Survey of Attitudes on Inequality (2009) data from
* your original data folder. 

* 2. Give the data set a label describing its contents. “describe” the data to 
	* make sure that data label appears correctly. Make all variable names 
	* lowercase for convenience. 
	
* 3. How many observations are in your data?
	
/* 4. Are there any duplicates in your data (cases that were listed twice)?
	Use the duplicates command to generate a variable that flags duplicate
	observations. Check to make sure that the code identifies dupes. Then,
	if there are duplicates, drop them. Check to make sure that the correct
	observations were deleted. */ 

/* 5. Using the codebook in your data folder, (a) rename V4 to something that 
	makes sense given its content, (b) label the var, & (c) assign value labels.
	“tab” the variable to make sure that the labels and values were assigned
	correctly. */ 
	
/* 6. Create a dummy variable called mom_worked that equals 1 if r's mom worked
	when respondents were 14-16 years old and 0 if she did not. Give the var. a
	label. Check its creation. */ 
	
/* 7. “tab” the social class variable, V66.  Note that very few people reported  
	being “upper class". Perhaps, because of SDRB, people are loathe to report
	that they are too high or too low on the class ladder. So, let's create a 
	new class variable called class that combines “upper middle class” and 
	“upper class” into one group and all other classes into another. 
	Be sure that all missing values are handled correctly. Attach value labels 
	to this new variable. Check its creation. */ 
	
/* 8. Next, create a table that displays mean values of mom_worked by country and 
	class. Format mom_worked so it does not have an excess precision. 
	
	Interpret your results.*/ 
	
/* 9. Now generate a variable that identifies individuals who completed “above 
	higher secondary level, other qualification” or higher degree versus those  
	who have completed less than this amount of schooling. Call this variable 
	gtsecondary. Check your variable creation. */
	
/* 10. Next, create a table that displays means on gtsecondary by country and 
	class. Format your table appropriately. Use this table to determine which 
	country sees the smallest differences in social class identification by 
	education. Again, consider formatting variables for readability. */ 
	
* 11. Load the CPS 2019 and construct a variable indicating whether someone has
	* any children. 

* 12. How does the gender wage gap for hourly workers relate to parental status? 
	
* 13. Does the effect of education on wages differ between non-white & white 
	* workers? Try to show this graphically. 
	
* 14. Create a dummy for Scandinavian birth. Use the restricted definition
	* (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) for the sake of time. Check your work!
	
* 15. Turn weekly pay into a dummy (so, meaning that someone has any weekly
	* income) and compare that to wage1. Are there any surprising results?
	
* 16. Finally, visualize the overall difference in distributions for white and 
	* non-white individuals.
